# Fluoride
## Introduction
Welcome to Fluoride! Fluoride is a SCaaS (spaghetti-code-as-a-service).
Fluoride obfuscates your code, making it practically unreadable by other engineers.

## Why Fluoride?
The spaghetti looks cool and makes it look like you know what you're doing.

## Requirements
This project (currently) only works with single-file applications.
**If you have imports, please bundle them into one file if possible. YOUR IMPORTS WILL (CURRENTLY) NOT BE OBFUSCATED
IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS!**
